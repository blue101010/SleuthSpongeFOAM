## Introduction

SleuthSpongeFOAM is a tool designed to automate counter-techniques for obfuscations and forensic analysis. 

As digital forensics evolves, there is a need for more advanced methods to address sophisticated obfuscation techniques. SleuthSpongeFOAM addresses this need by implementing Forensic Obfuscation Model (FOM) counter-techniques <https://github.com/blue101010/FOM>.

The tool automates for example the process of identifying and bypassing steganography and other obfuscation methods in digital images.

By systematically testing and penetrating layers of obfuscation, SleuthSpongeFOAM enhances forensic capabilities, ensuring comprehensive analysis and thorough investigation.

SleuthSpongeFOAM provides a reliable and efficient solution for digital forensic professionals seeking to improve their investigative processes and uncover concealed evidence.

## Status

This tool is just in early concept phase but is intended to implement FOM techniques.
The tool will be useful in various context (forensic analysis, incident analysis or Capture The Flag assistance).
